pytai
=====

Python library and scripts to work with tai64n timestamps.

I took pytai.py over from Michael T. Babcock a while back, as I work with
TAI64N timestamps a lot at work and wanted some portable utilities for working
with them.

See http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64n for more information.
